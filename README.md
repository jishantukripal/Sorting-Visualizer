## 🚀 Features

### 🌓 Theme Support
* **Dark & Light Mode:** Whether you prefer a sleek dark interface for late-night coding or a bright, crisp look for presentations, switch modes instantly with a single click.

Visualize how data moves and swaps with precision:
* **Bubble Sort:** Watch the largest elements "bubble" to the top.
* **Selection Sort:** See how the smallest element is selected in each pass.
* **Insertion Sort:** Understand how cards are sorted in a hand.
* **Merge Sort:** Visualize the divide-and-conquer strategy in action.

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
* **Linear Search:** Iterate through data one by one.
* **Binary Search:** Visualize the power of dividing the search space.

### 🎛️ Interactive Controls
* **Speed Control:** Slow down to understand, speed up to scan.
* **Custom Inputs:** Test edge cases with your own datasets.
* **Step-by-Step Execution:** Pause, play, and step through the logic.
